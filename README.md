## Generating Your Environment

You might have noticed in the file structure- there's already a Pipfile!

Install any additional dependencies you know you'll need for your project by
adding them to the `Pipfile`. Then run the commands:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

## Generating Your CLI

A CLI is, simply put, an interactive script and prompts the user and performs
operations based on user input.

You can run the template CLI with `python lib/cli.py`, or include the shebang
and make it executable with `chmod +x`. The template CLI will ask for input, do
some work, and accomplish some sort of task.

Of course, you will update `lib/cli.py` with prompts that are appropriate for
your application, and you will update `lib/helpers.py` to replace `helper_1()`
with a useful function based on the specific problem domain you decide to
implement, along with adding other helper functions to the module.

In the `lib/models` folder, you should rename `model_1.py` with the name of a
data model class from your specific problem domain, and add other classes to the
folder as needed. The file `lib/models/__init__.py` has been initialized to
create the necessary database constants. You need to add import statements to
the various data model classes in order to use the database constants.
