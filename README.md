## How to Use the CLI ðŸ›¬

When you run the CLI file, it will ask you to input from the choices given. 

For example, to view all the available flights:

On the Main menu, click **"1. Flights Information"**

The CLI will give you different options, then you have to type in **"1. Get all Flights"**

That will give you the input of all the flights the are available seen in this image:

## Room for Improvement

One of the features that can be improved in the future, is making sure the times and dates are validated per flight.

The flights can also be only selected from all the listed airports in the world. In short, a user cannot make up a random new airport code per city.  There can be a known list of airports to validate the city.

Another note of improvement would be adding prices to the flights, therefore having a total price per passenger on all his bookings. We can also add a feature wherein the user can find a flight, passenger by name or any of the attributes instead of the id. 

The user should be able to update a passenger information, booking information, and flight information.
